<P> I'm currently a Senior Researcher at <a href="http://dfinity.org">DFINITY</a> working on the design and implementation of the 
    Motoko programming language.
</p>

<p>Before that, I was a Principal RSDE in the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/ppt/">Programming 
		Principles and Tools</a> group at
		<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/labs/cambridge/">
		Microsoft Research Cambridge</a>, where I spent 18 years in both Researcher and Engineering roles.
</p>

<p> In this age of populism, I'm once worked on the world's most popular functional programming language (no, not Haskell).</p>

<p> My research interests include type systems and operational semantics for programming 
languages, especially module systems, functional and 
object-oriented languages. I also work on concurrency and parallelism and have dabbled with probabilistic programming.</p>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I obtained my <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/dts/students/photos/russo.jpg"> PhD </a>
in Computer Science under the supervision of
<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/dts/">Don Sannella </a>at the
<a href="http://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/">LFCS</a>, at the  
<a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>. Before joining 
Microsoft in 2000, I briefly worked for Harlequin Ltd. on their
<a href="http://www.functionalobjects.com/">Dylan</a> compiler.&nbsp; I designed and implemented the extended module system of
<a href="http://www.dina.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html">Moscow ML</a>, a popular 
byte-code compiler for Standard ML. I was also a post-doc researcher under
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~amp12/">Andrew Pitts</a> at the
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory</a>. 
At Microsoft, together with <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~akenn/">
Andrew Kennedy</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~nick/">Nick 
Benton</a>, I developed
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/TSG/SMLNET/">SML.NET</a>, a Standard 
ML compiler with object oriented extensions, that targets the Common Language 
Runtime and is integrated with Visual Studio .NET. Working with
<a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~akenn/">Andrew Kennedy</a> 
and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~dsyme/">Don Syme</a>, I&nbsp; contributed to the design and implementation of Generics 
on the Common Language Runtime, focussing on verification. I was also responsible for the implementation of the 
concurrency constructs in <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Comega/">C&#969;</a>, 
an extension of C# with native support for join patterns as well as type-safe 
manipulation of XML and SQL-like data.
Combining Generics and C&#969 led to my implementation of the <a href="joins/index.htm">Joins</a> 
 library, an efficient combinator library for C&#969;-style join
patterns implemented in C# 2.0 and easily usable from (at least) C# 2.0 and Visual Basic 8.0.

<h2>More Recent Stuff</h2>

<p>
Against all odds, I've worked on probabilistic programming, most recently on project
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/tabular/default.aspx">Tabular</a>, a machine learning add-in for Excel based on Infer.NET.
The software is currently unavailable for download due to site administration.
</p>

<p>
The original (lock-based) joins library served as the runtime for <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/concurrentbasic/default.aspx">Concurrent Basic</a> 
 - a natural extension of Visual Basic 9.0 with join pattern style concurrency. Thanks to 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/emeijer/">Erik Meijer</a> and
<a href="http://www.wischik.com/lu/">Lucian Wischik</a>  for their support.
</p>

<p>
Together with <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr/">John Reppy</a>, I worked on a parallel implementation of CML's higher-order concurrency constructs, 
primarily for <a href="http://manticore.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html">Manticore</a>  but also with a C# implementation for .NET.
</p>

<p>
Separately, 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/dimitris/">Dimitrios Vytiniotis</a>  and I have used
<a href="http://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a> to study type inference for <a href="qml/index.htm">QML</a>, a simple variant of
ML with impredicative polymorphism (think System F extended with ML's implicit let-polymorphism). 
</p>

<p>
I've also worked with
<a href="http://www.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/">Andreas Rossberg</a> and 
<a href="http://www.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/">Derek Dreyer</a> on formalizing variants of ML modules in Coq.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/turon/">Aaron Turon</a> and I came up with novel, non-blocking implementation of join patterns (a re-implemenation of the lock-based
C# Joins Library) that scales well on multi-core processors. This new implementation offers high-level, declarative synchronization (as before) with good parallel performance (the new bit).
</p>

<p>
I worked  with  <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/gmb/">Gavin Bierman</a>, Geoffrey Mainland, Erik Meijer and Mads Torgersen to give a high-level
operational semantics for C#'s latest feature, <i>asynchronous methods</i>. Asynchronous methods make it easy to write asynchronous, concurrent code without resorting to explicit 
continuation passing style. See our <i>ECOOP 2012</i> paper.
